#where do we use node in production?

- 3 full stack web applications

- 3 event driven applications

- 1 static image generator

- 2 high load apis

- 3 or 4 applications in the pipeline
---
layout: false

##what I will attempt to do

- explain how wdt (the web team) made the decision to node

- show off a quick prototype application

- go through some common problems

- show off some tools for running node in production

- show some tools that we use for ci/cd

- _not_ completely trash other languages

This should show two things. 1) how fast a prototype can be built (with a small amount of code) and how fast and stable a nodejs application can be.

#problems

(they are going to happen)
---
layout: false

##common nodejs problems

- handling event loops/callback hell

- memory leaks

- handling errors

- maxing out cpu

- network i/o bounds

- database connections/queries

???
what you write affects the server. you can take something down very quick with node just as much as you can with other languages

node is not a silver bullet

you can do stupid stuff in node

breaking servers will make you a better developer

monitor the shit out of your application!

---

#as a developer you will need to

- develop

- deploy

- handle scale

- monitor

- clean up your messes

???
prototyping anything can fall into production, so create well defined and well written prototypes
tools to help - node-load (for loadtesting)
    chrome dev tools (memory profiler)
    testing frameworks -- we use mocha
    test
    handle all sorts of errors, user/server/unrecoverable
    log as much as possible!

Your application should be able to handle a decent amount of load on its own.
load balancing and scaling with hardware might be necessary

better application monitoring and deployment
---
layout: false

##node application deployment

- unlike php you can't drop files on an server with apache and you're good

- as close to 100% uptime as possible

- use the available cores of the machine

- have some good logging

- scriptable monitoring

- ```forever start app.js``` is not the greatest solution

forever was serviceable at the beginning

- combined logging

#movement towards stable node environment and deployment

- from git clone/pull &amp;&amp; forever start app.js to automated deployment

- testing with mocha/chai

- using orm to create a more robust and stable model

- use pm2 to load balance requests across cores on a server
